I started programming by making mods for Minecraft in Java back in high school. That got me interested in creating full web applications, learning the theory behind it all, and educating myself on the processes and methodologies of software development. 

Fast forward to today, I have had the privilege of graduating from <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">King's College London</a> where I could satisfy my deepest curiosities and worked on [fantastic projects](/projects) and ventures with fellow students and professors. 

I have been travelling and upskilling for the past year. Learning more about cross-platform development and trying to pick up animation as well.

When I'm not building apps and learning, I usually spend the time writing, walking about London, or replaying Baldur's Gate. 

Here are some technologies I've been recently working with:

# Hello

Let’s begin by telling you why I even decided to start this endeavour, what I hope to gain by doing this, and what you can look forward to as you accompany me across this wonderful journey of me discharging all my newest findings and interests for you to read. Though I would like to point out that I will be curating my musings so that you dear reader will only see the cream of the crop.

The answer to those questions will be given all together, at the same time, without much structure or logic to it. A pattern that you will see commonly as you continue subjecting yourself to this journey. 

To put it simply I wanted to write. I always enjoyed writing but never had the bravado to put it out there for all to see and judge and comment terrible things underneath. But I have overcome that weakness so if you wish to comment terrible things underneath this post or send them to me in an email please go ahead, I would actually appreciate it. 

Beyond that, what I hope to gain from this is to give form and shape to my learning pursuits. I came up with the brilliant idea that if I wrote down all that I had read, seen, and learned the past week, I could better understand why I did what I did and plan for the future based on that newfound understanding.

Now with that understanding, I have grown tired of speaking of myself, so let us instead speak of what you can hope to read here every Friday -subject to change- and what form it will -usually- take.

## The World of Tech

I'll be talking about tech news and stories here. Since it is my job and hobby packaged into one, that is mostly what you can expect. It will be a bit technical but I shall strive to write in a manner that even my mum would understand. Since she will most likely be the sole reader of this blog/newsletter at least for the first few issues, it will be a fantastic testing metric.

I also wanted to keep myself updated on this nauseatingly fast-moving world to which I have attached myself. And what better way to achieve this than by the responsibility of curating relevant news with the goal of informing an audience? 

## Now for something completely different

Surprisingly my interests and hobbies do not end with tech. And although I could keep this newsletter completely tech-related, I will not. This won't be nearly as fun if I don't get to blabber about my new favourite book, or the diamond in the rough YouTuber who makes the most high-quality niche content on the platform, or the odd website whose only redeeming quality is the oddness. 

So while this blog will not be tech-exclusive, it will be tech-centric. Still, brace yourself to expect each issue to differ based on how my week has been. 

## In Conclusion

Keep yourself updated on tech and expect to find something to entertain yourself with too, as you look forward to this breathlessly each week. 

For now goodbye, and farewell.
